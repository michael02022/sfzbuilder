SFZBuilder needs a specific folder environment to make this work. This document specificies:
* What it should have
* What you can do
* What you cannot do

# STRUCTURE

```
# Root folder
This is basically the environment for all these files. You can put this folder on whatever ubication of your drive. It's the capsule for all the presets made.

# MappingPool folder
This is where ALL mappings are stored. The name of the folders should at least have:
* Author
* Name of the pack
Example: `NiceSounds - Texture Collections`
## Pack folder
Under this folder, you can organize the maps **whatever you want**, also you can store documentation, readmes, licenses and so on to give information to the user.
### Conditions for the mappings
Whatever you put the samples, the sfz file mapping **ALWAYS should be in the same folder as the samples.** The SFZ map files must load the samples in the same place (no paths, only filenames in the `sample=` opcode).

**Why?** 

This is so that the mappings can be used in other samplers that have SFZ import. And to maintain compatibility (and the integrity of the environment) they must load them without any kind of path (absolute or relative).

**Another must** is these must cover the entire MIDI value spectrum for key and velocity (0 - 127).

#### Opcodes allowed
This is not exactly a strict rule, technically you are free to use the opcodes you want, but you have to keep in mind at least these basic opcodes to make sure another players (and samplers with SFZ imports) can load these mappings and let the mappings being flexible as possible when a preset is made.
The essential opcodes for mappings are:
* sample
* pitch_keycenter
* lokey
+ hikey
* tune

DO NOT use `key` opcode because this are used when a preset is made. This means for percussion instruments must be `pitch_keycenter=60 lokey=0 hikey=127`, for flexibility reasons.

These opcodes should be present if FLAC/OGG files are involved (not all sfz players/importers support this metadata for those formats):
* loop_mode
* loop_type
* direction
* loop_start
* loop_end

An optional opcode for special cases like release samples, are allowed. Although these could be overriden if the preset uses them:
* offset

# Preset folder
This folder is where you store the presets generated by SFZBuilder (technically you could make them manually too). You can store the presets whatever you want, only make sure all is under a folder of the same name as your pack to avoid confusion/unorganization.

# Projects folders
This is where you store the project files from SFZBuilder, is optional if you want to share them or not to the end user.

# How to share a pack
Basically you should preserve this structure with all the stuff needed to make everything work. And that's what you are going to share to the end user. So the end user would just cut-paste your pack into their local SFZBuilder environment folder and there you go. The end user has installer your pack ready to use and make new presets with them.
